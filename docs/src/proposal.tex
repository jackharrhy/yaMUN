\section{Introduction}
While putting together a course schedule for a semester, it can be tedious to figure out what's being offered for an entire department/semester. You have to view each subject in its own context and then view 
each course with its offerings on its own dedicated page. Even then, once you've found a course, you're told when it occurs on what days, but not if it conflicts with another course you want to take, 
only once you are inserting multiple CRNs into the final step do you become informed there are issues with your selection. \par
Our goal is to design a system that makes searching for courses to construct a schedule by different fields more ergonomic and comfortable. To achieve our goal, we need to collect publicly available data from the 
Memorial University website; this includes course descriptions from the University Calendar and information about courses from the course offerings pages and Banner, which are published by the registrar's office 
each semester.
\section{Proposal}
As mentioned in the introduction, our team wants to design and create a dashboard that would make planning and constructing course schedules more ergonomic and comfortable for Memorial University students. 
Unfortunately, the data we need is not available for download, but published on the university website. In order to work around that, we will need to create a program that would crawl the required pages and extract 
the data using regular expressions. \par
Our system will mainly work with the data that we will collect from the course offering pages. This data contains available subjects, course names, course codes, sections, CRNs, course dates, times and days 
during which the course requires attendance, the amount of credit hours a course is, and the name of the instructor. \par
Additionally, we would like to enrich the course offerings data with course descriptions from the Memorial University calendar and instructor contact information from the "People Search" API that is publicly 
available. We believe that this extra data will provide our users with great convenience, eliminating the need to be constantly switching between web pages to gather information on a course.
\section{Functionalities}
The most essential functionalities of our system revolve around the construction and editing of a user's personalized course list. The primary operation is the ability to list all course offerings and their 
information, and allow the user to add whichever ones they choose to their list, and to give them the ability to remove said courses from the list afterwards. \par
We intend to allow the user to receive a bounty of useful information, including pulling course descriptions from the university calendar, listing the courses' prerequisites, and collecting instructor's contact 
information from the aforementioned "People Search" API. To browse through the courses, you start from a raw list of all courses, where the user can then choose to sort by a specific attribute (Subject, Professor, Time, etc.), or the user can place a keyword into a search bar and be shown relevant results. This can be searching for a course by name, 
searching for all courses taught by a specific instructor, etc. We will install multiple optional filters as well. Much like Memorial's system, you will be able to list all courses in a specific subject, 
and from there filter out time slot conflicts, closed courses, or particular methods of delivery the user cannot participate in (a specific campus, online delivery).\par
Once a course is added, our system will check if the added course's time slot conflicts with any other courses they have selected, and allow them the option to keep the course, discard the course, or to search for a 
better fitting course in the same subject, if one exists. As well, the system will alert the user if they are not enrolled in the same campus as the course selected. \par
Users will be able to bookmark courses and view them separately as well, if there is an instance where a user cannot decide between two conflicting courses, they can bookmark both and return to them at a later date 
to make a decision. You will be able to view the courses you select in both a raw listing, and a weekly schedule format, with courses listed during their respective time slots.
